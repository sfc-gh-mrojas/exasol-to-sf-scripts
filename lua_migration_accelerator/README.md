## üß© **App Overview: Exasol Lua Accelerator**

### üéØ **Purpose**

This Streamlit app is designed to help developers **migrate legacy scripts (written in Exasol SQL, Lua, Java, or Python)** into **Snowflake Snowpark Python stored procedures**. It integrates with **Snowflake Cortex ** to automatically rewrite code using AI, making the modernization process faster and more consistent.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation & Deployment (on Snowflake)**

To deploy this app in Snowflake‚Äôs **Native Streamlit Hosting**, follow these steps:

### üßæ **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. ### ‚úÖ **Create a Python file**

   Save the contents of your app (i.e., the provided `lua_migration_accelerator.py`) locally.

   Open on a local editor select all the contents.

2. ### üì¶ **Upload to Snowflake**

   Open your Snowflake **Snowsight console**, and go to **Apps > Streamlit**. Click **+ Streamlit App**.

3. ### üß≠ **Configure the App**

   * **Name:** Choose a descriptive name, like `lua_migration_accelerator`

   You need to specify a database, schema and a warehouse
   

4. ### üîê **Permissions**

    In order to upload files you need to grant your role access to the Snowflake stage used by the app.

5. ### üöÄ **Launch the App**

   After deployment, click **Open Streamlit App**. You can now upload files, select them, and use the AI-assisted migration feature.

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Script Migration Assistant**     | Converts legacy scripts into Snowpark-compatible Python stored procedures using AI (Snowflake Cortex).                    |
| **2. File Upload to Snowflake Stage** | Allows users to upload files directly into a selected Snowflake internal stage.                                           |
| **3. File Viewer with Migration UI**  | Lists and previews files stored in a Snowflake stage. Lets users select files, view contents, and run migrations.         |
| **4. Customizable Prompt Template**   | Users can adjust the AI prompt template that controls how scripts are translated.                                         |

### üß† **Typical Workflow**

1. **Select a Snowflake stage** in the sidebar.
2. **Upload script files** (Lua/Java/Exasol SQL/Python) via the uploader.
3. **Switch to File Viewer**, refresh the list, and select files to process.
4. **View and migrate** code using Snowflake Cortex with one click.
5. **Review original vs. migrated output** in tabs for each file.
6. Optionally, **customize the AI prompt** in Settings to fine-tune behavior.
